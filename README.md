## SHOT Dataset
SHOT is the first large-scale dataset for Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), consisting of 1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6 types of individual attributes. The dataset is designed with 3 key characteristics: **multi-individual information**, **multi-view adaptability**, and **multi-level intention**.

The basic structure is shown as following, with more details of implementation to be updated...
